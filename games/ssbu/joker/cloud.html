			<h4>Overview</h4>
			<p class="mu-summary"><strong>Solidly in Joker's favor</strong>. I've played this matchup from both ends and it feels like the matchup strongly favors Joker. Understand that his primary and safest approach options involve landing on you with aerials. Although Cloud has some great assets from his mobility and his normal attacks, he leaves enough openings in frame data and hitboxes for Joker to exploit. For example, if Cloud intends to land on you with an aerial he's likely vulnerable to interceptions in the air before he can throw out an attack. <br></br>
			</p>
				<p class="mu-summary-weakness">
				Cloud's weaknesses
			</p>
				<ol class="pros">
					<li>
						<span class="pros">Offstage</span> <span class="pros-body">- His weak offstage game is a massive weakspot that a character like Joker can <em>easily</em> take advantage of for early kills. Although Cloud has some recovery mixups, Joker has the tools to keep up with him. On the other hand, Cloud can't contest Joker offstage nearly as well and any attempt to make plays in this area carries huge risks for Cloud should the Joker opt to reverse any edgeguard attempts.</span>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<span class="pros">Cloud's DI Habits</span> <span class="pros-body">- Any Cloud player that has even a little experience in the matchup knows that being offstage is incredibly dangerous to be against Joker as it's super easy to get gimped by Joker's Gun. With this in mind, it's likely that near the ledge Cloud players are relatively more likely than other characters to DI <em>in</em> to your attacks in fear of being knocked off stage. Knowing that Cloud is more likely to DI in can help you predict his movements. In constrast, characters with effective recoveries like Pac-Man or Pikachu have no issue with DI-ing away from your attacks even if they're offstage since they can recover from anywhere.</span>
								</li>
							</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="pros">"Predictiable" Approach Options</span> <span class="pros-body">- I wrote "Predictable" in quotes because the Cloud can try to alleviate this weakness by trying to space his aerials to make them more difficult to punish or mix up his approach options. However, Cloud's approach option is usually going to be approaching with a landing aerial. This can make him predictable and thus provides a clear picture for how he intends to move. If you believe the Cloud intends to land on you with a F-air then you can then attempt to intercept him with your own aerial before he can finish winding up.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="pros">Terrible Grab Game</span> <span class="pros-body">- Cloud's Grabs/Throws are the least intimidating of their kind in the entire game. Out of the entire roster as of Kazuya's release and there isn't a single character with a worse grab game than Cloud. His grab isn't the slowest, but they <em>are</em> slow (9 Frames) and coupled with his tiny T-Rex style grab range his grabs make for a lackluster and unreliable option. In addition, most of Cloud's attacks outside of Limit Cross Slash don't inflict much shield damage, making Shield a safe and effective tool for many of his options. Grab can punish players who shield excessively, but as will be explained in more detail, there are so many worse things to be on the receiving end of than Cloud's Grab.</span>
							<ol>
								<li>
										<span class="pros">Grab</span> <span class="pros-body">- Slow (9 Frame) startup and low range makes his grabs slow and unreliable. His Dash Grab and Pivot Grab are equally terrible.</span>
								</li>
								<li>
									<span class="pros">Throws</span> <span class="pros-body">- If you do happen to get grabbed there's not much to worry about as his throws are just as awful as his grabs, but there are some caveats to watch out for; more on that later. Firstly, Cloud's grabs have little to no true followups, mainly inflicting a small amount of damage and repositioning the enemy. Second, his throws have almost no KO potential, with maybe Down-Throw killing at around 200%+. <br></br>
									The caveat is that some of his throws <em>can</em> lead to followups if you aren't paying attention and do nothing. At low percents, Down-Throw can lead to Cross Slash and Back-Throw can lead to a Tech-Chase situation where Cloud can punish with a Dash-Attack. For Mid/High percents Back-Throw can be used to throw the opponent off-stage where the Cloud can then run-off and follow-up with Limit Cross Slash. <!-- Cloud v DK 3/13 --> </span>

				<p class="mu-summary-strength">
				Cloud's Strengths
			</p>
				<ol class="cons">
					<li>
						<span class="cons">Mobility</span> <span class="cons-body">- His mobility paired with his burst options(Dash Attack, Limit Cross Slash, Up-Smash) can make him quite intimidating when you find yourself cornered at the ledge.</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span class="cons">Defensive Options</span> <span class="cons-body">- Cloud's approach options can be relatively predictable, but when he has the luxury of playing defensively, such as if he happens to have a stock lead, his ability to wall out approaches with (Bair, Upair, Cross Slash) can result in you falling further and further behind.</span>
						</li>
						<li>
								<span class="cons">Limit</span> <span class="cons-body">- Cloud's Limit is particulary powerful here. Normally, offstage is sort of Joker's territory in this matchup, but with Limit Cloud can pose a huge threat offstage with the ability to edgeguard with Limit Blade Beam or Limit Cross Slash. Be wary of Cloud throwing out his Limit abilities when you are trying to recover. Cloud's limit abilities exude a ton of pressure especially when you are behind because he can go from being slightly ahead to massively ahead. However, Rebel's Guard is effective against Limit, and although it can be punished it remains a reliable option in this matchup.</span>
